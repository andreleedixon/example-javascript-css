    <p>Imagine a world where there is no fear, pain, hunger, and devoid of all negativity.
        Place yourself at the feet of peace, nesting on the soft clouds of tranquility, 
        while feasting at the table of fellowship in the comfort of love. We challenge ourselves
        to be free and we demand from others nothing more than the respect they expect from us. 
        We find ourselves carving rules in society in the same way that we carve our lovers names 
        in our favorite trees.</p>
        
        <p>I try to remember the most important things my Father taught me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Generosity</li>
            <li>Laughter</li>
            <li>Fellowship</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When people want me to list my top five things that make me come alive.</p>

        <p>I want them to take with them these items:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Family</li>
            <li>Friends</li>
            <li>Fellowship</li>
            <li>Joy</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Always remember what is important to you and what makes you feel good about yourself!</p>

        <p> <a href="https://math.mit.edu/">My MIT Math Home Page</a>  is where this has started for 
        me and I will forever be greatful for what it will soon bring to my life's purpose.</p>

<!-- 
  The reason the instructions (above) place the <script> element near the bottom
  of the HTML file is that the browser reads code in the order it appears
  in the file.
  If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't
  loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML
  page is one way to accommodate the dependency, To learn more about alternative approaches,
  see Script loading stategies.

Example of function:

  let x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
}
